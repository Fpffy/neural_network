# Hndwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Network

<img src='drawings/title.jpg'></img>

This repository contains implementation of dense neural network in NumPy for handwritten digit recognition. For training the network MNIST database was used. Notebook ```neural_network_model``` have detailed description of implementation, while ```neural_netowork_model_code``` is just pure code. 

## Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python
* Pacages: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Imageio, Scikit-Image
